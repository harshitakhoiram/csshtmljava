  <div>*** here the "div" element stands for division
    it is a very generic block level element.
    contents inside "div" elements has it's own line as it is a block level
    element.
    DIV 1: Some content here ***</div>
  <div>
    *** DIV 2: Following right after div 1***
  </div>
  <span>***SPAN1 : Following right after div 2***
    it is a inline element.
    even tho 'span' is an inline element, here the contents of this 'span'
    will have it's own line because, the element before this was 'div', 
    which needs it's own line and hence the 'span' will be pushed to the
    next line.
  </span>
  <div>
    *** DIV 3 : Following right after span 1***
  <span>
    ****SPAN 2: Inside div 3***
    the span element is an inline element and here, it is inside a div element,
    'span' being a inline element, it doesnot have it's own line and the
    contents within 'span' will be displayed in the same line as div.
  </span>
