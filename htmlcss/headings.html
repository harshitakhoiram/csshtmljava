    <h1>THIS IS THE MAIN HEADING (this attribute is for heading)</h1> 
    <h2>Subheading 2</h2>
    <h3>Subheading 3</h3>
    <h4>Subheading 4</h4>
    <h5>Subheading 5</h5>
    <h6>Subheading 6 (this is also a heading but the least important one)
      (As we can see, the main heading is numbered as h1 and then comes
      the subsequent headings one after the other, from most imporatant to 
      least important). So the browser defaulted the styling of the text of 
      each heading from the most important being the biggest in size and 
      the least important being the smallest in size. So it visually tells
      us about the most important and the least important one.
      moreover, h1 is a semantic tag and helps in search engine optimization.
